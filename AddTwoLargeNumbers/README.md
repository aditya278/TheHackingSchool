#### Code for Adding two very large numbers.

The Input is provided to the ```addVeryLargeNumbers()``` function in a form of a string.
Since the max value for an integer is ```Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER``` i.e. 2<sup>53</sup> - 1, so we need to pass the numbers as a string.

To run the code use the below command:
```javascript
node addTwoLargeNumbers.js
```
