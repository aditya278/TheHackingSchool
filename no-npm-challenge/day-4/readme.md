# Implementing RESTful APIs with ONLY CORE Node JS Modules
### No NPM Challenge

### Steps to follow:

7. Implementing REST APIs today. Will send the payload from the client, and based on the method we'll route the request.
(REST APIs: In short, CRUD Operation over a network)
8. Will have to hash the password
9. Implement Backend validation

#### Day 4 Summary : 
- Created a separate Router Handler script for handling the REST Methods
- Going to create handlers for : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- Also going to implement User Creation functionality, in which for each registered user a new file will be created. (File system is acting as a data repository here)
- Also going to implement a Helper script which going to take care of password hasing using built in crypto module.
